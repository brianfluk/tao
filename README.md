# tao
This is a site containing a JavaScript extension for dictionary function, notepad function, 
and some other functions, to be ported to the TAO testing system as a plugin. 

This site uses ExpressJS, node.js.
Dictionary function uses pure JavaScript, and possibly RequireJS,
which is a JavaScript file, so it should be able to be imported
into TAO.

To run:
* Clone this repository
* Install node.js
* Go the the directory
* "npm install"
* "npm start"

When working with this:
* Do NOT push node_modules/ -- this may or may not create issues (or just be annoying, idk heard sth about this)
